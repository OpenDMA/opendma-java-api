# OpenDMA API for Java

At it's core, OpenDMA (Open Document Management Architecture) defines an
abstract model for Document Management and Enterprise Content Management
Systems.

The OpenDMA API provides an abstract interface to this model. It allows
to write content centric applications once, and run them against multiple
different Enterprise Content and Document Management Systems.

The API is available for different programming languages and enforces a
consistent style across these languages.

This repository contains the OpenDMA API for Java.

It has been auto-generated by the [OpenDMA API Builder](https://github.com/OpenDMA/opendma-api-builder).

## Installation

This project is not yet available on Maven Central.

To install it locally, check out this git project and run `mvn clean install`.

## Usage

The OpenDMA API defines a set of interfaces that need to be implemented by an
OpenDMA Adaptor for an actual ECM system -- very similar to database drivers.

The [OpenDMA XML Repository](https://github.com/OpenDMA/opendma-java-xmlrepo)
implements these interfaces using object descriptions stored in an XML file.

There is also a complete [OpenDMA Tutorial for Java](https://github.com/OpenDMA/opendma-java-tutorial)
showing the basic concepts with the XML Repository.
